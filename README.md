Hi there! 👋 I'm Abegail Fontanilla
- 👀 I’m interested in Math, Data Analytics, AI tools, and automation.
- 📊 I’m currently learning data analytics, AI, and VBA to automate workflows and optimize decision-making through data.
- 💼 I previously worked as a Category Analyst at Gingersnaps PH, and worked on forecasting inventory, and analyzing sales trends to optimize inventory performance.
- 🛠️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects, automation scripts, and AI-powered tools.
- 📫 How to reach me: abbeyfontanilla@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I went from writing math problems to solving real-world ones with data—and I still enjoy both! 😄
